    <strong>Journalist & Creative Writer</strong>

    <p>I am a journalist with experience in both investigative and community journalism. I am also a creative writer who specializes in short fiction and poetry.</p>

    <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
    
    <h3>Staff Writer and Administrator</h3>
    <h4>Emmitsburg News-Journal</h4>
    <h5>July 2019 - Current</h5>
    <p>As Catoctin High School sports writer for three years, I wrote 1,200-word monthly sports articles on the topic of my choice, from COVID-related restrictions in the athletics department to a football team’s state championship. I continue to write community-related articles from town hall meetings to feature articles about local individuals and shops.</p>

    <h4>Wanted in Rome</h4>	
    <h5>May 2025 - June 2025</h5>
    <p>Assignments consisted of exploring Rome and finding stories to cover throughout the city. By the end of the internship, I published an article relating the depictions of life in Rome during World War II in the 1946 film "Rome, Open City" to my grandmother's experience as a young civilian living in fascist Italy.</p>

    <h3>Investigative Intern</h3>
